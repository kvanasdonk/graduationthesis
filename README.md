# PINEM with Optical Fibers | Graduation thesis | MATLAB simulation code 
K. E. van Asdonk

This is the MATLAB simulation code repository for my graduation thesis titled 'PINEM with Optical Fibers'.
PINEM stands for Photon-Induced Near-field Electron Microscopy: an advanced imaging technique involving the quantum energy exchange between an electron beam and optically excited photon fields near a mediating nanosctructure or surface. 

The goal of these simulations is to predict the strength of the PINEM effect for tapered optical fibers in the order of 1 micron diameter.
